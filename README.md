# Media Bias Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a media bias ratings dataset from AllSides Media. The goal is to understand the distribution and trends of media bias across different news sources. The project includes data preprocessing, visualization, and documentation of findings, all performed in a single Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Motivation
In today's polarized media landscape, understanding media bias is crucial for fostering informed and critical news consumption. This project aims to identify patterns, commonalities, and outliers in media bias ratings. It also serves to enhance my skills in Python, data analysis, and visualization while deepening my understanding of media influence and bias.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examining the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the data using Matplotlib and seaborn to illustrate bias distributions and trends.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the analysis process and results in a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment**: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks
